## Overview

BinDays-API is the server-side component for the BinDays project. It provides the logic and configuration for retrieving bin collection schedules from UK councils.

It works with a client application ([BinDays-App](https://github.com/BadgerHobbs/BinDays-App), [BinDays-Client](https://github.com/BadgerHobbs/BinDays-Client)) to fetch data.

### How It Works

The API doesn't scrape councils directly. Instead, it generates request configurations (URLs, headers, payloads) and sends them to a client. The client executes the HTTP request and sends the raw response back to the API for processing.

This approach has a few benefits:

- **Avoids IP Blocking:** Council requests come from the user's IP, not a server, which avoids blocks, rate-limiting, and CAPTCHAs.
- **Dynamic Updates:** Collector logic can be updated server-side without requiring a client app update.
- **Stateless & Lightweight:** The API is stateless with no external dependencies.

## Deployment

The API is containerized for deployment with Docker.

### Run the Public Image

Deploy the pre-built image from the GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
docker run -d
    --name bindays-api
    -p 8080:8080
    ghcr.io/badgerhobbs/bindays-api:latest
```

### Build from Source

Build the Docker image locally:

```bash
docker build -t bindays-api:latest .
```
