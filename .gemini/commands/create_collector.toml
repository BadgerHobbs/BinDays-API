description="Creates a new council collector from previously fetched data."
prompt = """
You are an AI coding agent tasked with the second step of adding support to the BinDays API for a new council: implementation. You must follow all principles and instructions in the `GEMINI.md` file.

Your task is to use the data files generated by the `/fetch_collector_data` command to create a new council collector. The required files (`council_info.json`, `address_request`, `address_response`, `binday_request`, `binday_response`) should be present in the root directory.

Your detailed workflow is as follows:

1.  **Read Input Files:**
    - Read the `council_info.json` file to get the council name, `GovUkId`, and website URL.
    - Read the address and bin day request/response files.

2.  **Implementation and Testing:**
    - Using the data from the files and by referencing existing collectors, implement the new council collector class in `BinDays.Api.Collectors/Collectors/Councils/`.
    - Implement the corresponding integration test in `BinDays.Api.IntegrationTests/Collectors/Councils/`.
    - You will need to extract the necessary information from the saved HTML/JSON responses to create the required regular expressions for address and bin day parsing.
    - Run the test and debug until it passes, ensuring you remove any temporary debug code.
